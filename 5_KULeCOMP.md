In the footsteps of the MeLO seminar series, the KU Leuven Colloquia in Medieval Philosophy is a hybrid forum that aims to foster networking and collaboration especially among early-career scholars in medieval philosophy.

The seminar meets once month, in a hybrid format (on Zoom as well as in person at KU Leuven) to discuss a pre-read paper, in any area of medieval thought (roughly in the time period between 500â€“1700, East or West). Presenters give a brief, 10-minute summary, usually supplying the readers with some context of the paper, after which we devote the remaining time to discussion and general feedback. We welcome works in progress at every stage of their completion.
