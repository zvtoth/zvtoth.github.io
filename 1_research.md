I have embarked on a few different research topics in the last decade or so: the most current on is on early 14th-century theories of matter. While the most general concept of matter -- or prime matter -- seems relatively straightforward in an Aristotelian framework, the devil is in the details, and those are what I am trying to tackle. How many *kinds* of prime matter are there? Are the celestial bodies made of the same kind of matter as we are? What is matter like? What about its potency? Does it essentially have its potencies or are those accidental to it? These are just a few of the questions medieval thinkers tackled in various works. By looking at a considerable number of sources, we are also trying to figure out whether these questions -- and their answers -- showed any diversity along religious orders or geographical locations. 

In earlier projects, I dealt mostly with medieval theories of causation and divine concurrence. What do we mean precisely when we say that the fire is cracking in the fireplace *because* I lit it? Is this merely a way of everyday talking, to be abandoned after some philosophical reflection, or are there really things acting on each other? Would our answer be different if there were some higher agent (God) who is responsible for every being at every moment of their existence? In the last few decades' emerging neo-Aristotelian metaphysics, some of these questions have received revived attention --- but surprisingly, these treatments leave  the richest tradition devoted to them unmentioned. With my research on medieval accounts of causation and divine concurrence I aimed to somewhat fill this gap.

Working at Indiana University, I also explored the thought of Richard Rufus, an early thirteenth-century Franciscan, who was the first one we know in the West commenting on Aristotle's *Metaphysics*. For materials connected to Rufus, see the website of the <a href="http://rrp.stanford.edu" target = "_blank">Rufus Project</a>.

Read the (now somewhat outdated) <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/1_research/research.pdf">longer research statement</a>, or the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/1_research/dissum.pdf">summary of a dissertation</a> where it all began.

Beside medieval philosophy, I am much interested in some contemporary issues in Metaphysics and Philosophy of Religion -- hence the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/archive/Religion">Philosophy of Religion Workshop Series</a> I so much enjoyed organizing back in 2015/16.
