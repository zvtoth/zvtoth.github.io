My office is in the Strand Philosophy Building, room 709. In the spring 2024, my official office hours are Tuesdays, 16.00–17.00 (and Fridays 13.00–14.00 via Teams), but you can come any time as long as you make an appointment, by clicking on the preferred date and time below. Or, if you come by and my door is open, that means I am here – feel free to come in.
