I am always happy to hear from students interested in any area of medieval philosophy, philosophy of religion, or some metaphysical issues.

Currently, my MPhil and PhD students work on William James's 'will to believe' argument; on Antonius Andreae's natural philosophy; and on Aquinas's take on the devil. I am also co-supervising a PhD dissertation in Theology on Duns Scotus.

I am part of the <a href="https://www.komldsp.org.uk" target="_blank">"Knowledge Orders before Modernity"</a> project, a Leverhulme doctoral scholarship programme, which offers funding to PhD students interested in a broad range of topics in medieval studies.
