I am always happy to hear from students interested in any area of medieval philosophy, philosophy of religion, or some metaphysical issues.

Currently, my MPhil students work on the notion of *creatio ex nihilo* East and West; on William James's will to believe argument; and on the doctrine of Divine Simplicity. I am also supervising a PhD dissertation in Theology on Duns Scotus.

I am part of the "Knowledge Orders before Modernity" project, a Leverhulme doctoral scholarship programme, which offers funding to PhD students interested in a broad range of topics in medieval studies. <a href="https://www.komldsp.org.uk" target="_blank"> Read more about the project </a>.
