I am always happy to hear from students interested in any area of medieval philosophy, philosophy of religion, or some metaphysical issues.

Currently, my MPhil students work on the notion of *creatio ex nihilo* East and West; on William James's will to believe argument; and on the doctrine of Divine Simplicity. I am also supervising a PhD dissertation in Theology on Duns Scotus.


### MA theses supervised

- Mario Bison, "Sacred Doctrine as *scientia* in St Thomas Aquinas's *Summa Theologiae*"
- Preedant Jareonsettasin, "What is an Account of Something's Nature?"
