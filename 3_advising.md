I am always happy to hear from students interested in any area of medieval philosophy, philosophy of religion, or some metaphysical issues.

Currently, my MPhil students work on the notion of *creatio ex nihilo* East and West; on William James' will to believe argument; and medieval Islamic philosophy. I am also supervising a thesis in Theology on Duns Scotus.
