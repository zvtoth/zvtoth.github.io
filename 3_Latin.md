The Latin Reading Group has recently transformed into a Paleography reading group. We meet once every week via Zoom, right now on Thursdays at 4:30 p.m. CET, and read and transcribe from a manuscript. Currently (Fall 2022) we are working on De Fonseca's commentary on the *De sensu*, in an early modern cursive script (but this is somewhat unusual as our focus is mostly gothic book hand).

In earlier semesters we read from John Buridan's commentary on the *De memoria* (in a 14th-century anglicana script); from the *Life of St. Cuthbert* by Bede (Carolingian script); and from an anonymous Vatican Lateran ms. (14th-century gothic book hand).

The paleography skills of the group participants occupy a big range, and everyone is welcome. It is easier than it looks like, and very easy to get used to it! If interested, please <a href="mailto:tothzit@gmail.com">send me an email</a>.

In earlier semesters I had lead the CSC Latin Reading Group, where we read some of <a href="https://www.augustinus.it/latino/commento_lsg/index2.htm" target="_blank"> Augustine's sermons</a>, and earlier the <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/egeria.html" target="_blank">*Itinerarium Egeriae*</a>, the travel diary of a 4th-century Spanish pilgrim woman traveling to the Holy Land.




I also used to coordinate the Fordham Philosophy Latin Reading Group, a group of students and faculty whose primary interest is medieval philosophy.
