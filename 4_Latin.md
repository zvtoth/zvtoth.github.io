### The Latin Philosophy Reading Group

In Spring 2023 we are reading Aquinas's *Summa Theologiae*. We are meeting every Monday from 2 to 3 p.m., in the Philosophy building, room 508. Everyone is welcome to join, regardless of Latin proficiency.

### Virtual Paleography Group

We meet once every week via Zoom, right now on Wednesdays at 7 p.m. London time, and read and transcribe from a manuscript. Currently (Autumn 2022) we are working on Peter Auriol's quodlibet (Assisi Bibl. comm. 136).

In earlier semesters we read from Peter of Auvergne's *Sentences* commentary; De Fonseca's *De sensu* (in a modern cursive script); John Buridan's commentary on the *De memoria* (in a 14th-century anglicana script); from the *Life of St. Cuthbert* by Bede (Carolingian script); and from an anonymous Vatican Lateran ms. (14th-century gothic book hand).

The paleography skills of the group participants occupy a big range, and everyone is welcome. It is easier than it looks like! If interested, please <a href="mailto:tothzit@gmail.com">send me an email</a>.

### Archive

In earlier semesters I had lead the CSC Latin Reading Group, where we read some of <a href="https://www.augustinus.it/latino/commento_lsg/index2.htm" target="_blank"> Augustine's sermons</a>, and earlier the <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/egeria.html" target="_blank">*Itinerarium Egeriae*</a>, the travel diary of a 4th-century Spanish pilgrim woman traveling to the Holy Land.

I also used to coordinate the Fordham Philosophy Latin Reading Group, a group of students and faculty whose primary interest is medieval philosophy.
