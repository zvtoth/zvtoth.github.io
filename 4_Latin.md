### The KCL Latin Philosophy Reading Group

In the spring 2024 we are meeting every Wednesday from 12 to 1 p.m., in the Philosophy building, room 508. Currently we are reading one of Duns Scotus's quodlibetal questions on free will. In earlier terms we read from Aquinas's *Summa theologiae*, as well as from Su√°rez's *Metaphysical Disputations*. 
Everyone is welcome to join, regardless of Latin proficiency.

### Virtual Paleography Group

We meet once every week via Zoom, right now on Fridays at 4 p.m. London time, and read and transcribe from a manuscript. Currently (Spring 2024) we are working on Buridan's commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics (Vat. Urb. 198).

In earlier semesters we read from Peter Auriol's Quodlibet; Peter of Auvergne's *Sentences* commentary; De Fonseca's *De sensu* (in a modern cursive script); John Buridan's commentary on the *De memoria* (in a 14th-century anglicana script); from the *Life of St. Cuthbert* by Bede (Carolingian script); and from an anonymous Vatican Lateran ms. (14th-century gothic book hand).

The paleography skills of the group participants occupy a big range, and everyone is welcome. It is easier than it looks like! If interested, please <a href="mailto:zita.v.toth@kcl.ac.uk">send me an email</a>.

### Archive

In earlier semesters I had lead the CSC Latin Reading Group, where we read some of <a href="https://www.augustinus.it/latino/commento_lsg/index2.htm" target="_blank"> Augustine's sermons</a>, and earlier the <a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/egeria.html" target="_blank">*Itinerarium Egeriae*</a>, the travel diary of a 4th-century Spanish pilgrim woman traveling to the Holy Land.

I also used to coordinate the Fordham Philosophy Latin Reading Group, a group of students and faculty whose primary interest is medieval philosophy.
