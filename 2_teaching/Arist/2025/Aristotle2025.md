### Bibliography

There is an immense amount of literature both on Aristotle in general and on practically every one of his major ideas. These books are only meant to give you a start; the best thing to do is to check out their bibliography and see if you find anything that looks relevant to your topic. As always, the SEP is also a good resource.
