This course is an introduction to the most important philosophical problems related to human nature. The course is centered around three main topics: (1) What is to be a human being, and how body and soul are related; (2) What is knowledge, and whether we can know anything; (3) The problem of religious belief. We consider various basic philosophical approaches to these questions, together with the context in which they arose.
