<p style="margin-left: 40px; line-height: 0.9"><small>According to most medieval thinkers, whenever something causally acts on another thing, God also acts with it. Durand of St.-Pour\c{c}ain, an early fourteenth-century Dominican philosopher, disagrees. Instead, he maintains what has come to be called a `mere conservationist' view, claiming that created causes alone are sufficient to bring about their effects.
This paper is about a fourteenth-century objection to mere conservationism, which I will call the *Fiery Furnace objection*, as formulated by Durand's contemporary, Peter of Palude.  In short, the Fiery Furnace objection shows that if we test our theories of divine
concurrence against a case that involves a specific kind of miracles, then it turns out that mere conservationism is rather problematic. Although Peter of Palude is not usually regarded as an overwhelmingly original thinker, this paper calls attention to one of his more interesting controversies with his contemporary Dominican confriar, while also clarifies how some medieval thinkers understood the broadly speaking Aristotelian conviction that causes and effects must be necessarily related.</small></p>


<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/1_research/Toth2019a_0.pdf">"Perfect Subjects, Shields, and Retractions: Three Models of Impassibility,"</a> <i>Vivarium</i>, forthcoming.
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; line-height: 0.9"><small>According to theological consensus at least from the thirteenth century, at the End of Times our body will be resurrected and reunited with our soul. The resurrected body, although numerically identical to our present one, will be quite different: it will possess clarity, agility, subtility, and the inability to suffer. There are two reasons why impassibility presents a problem in the medieval framework. The first has to do with how to characterize impassibility more precisely; the second arises because at first it may seem that impassiblity is not metaphysically possible at all. I am going to look at three attempts to tackle these problems: those of Aquinas, Durand of St.-Pourçain, and Peter of Palude. As I hope to show, looking at how causal powers work on the New Earth may shed some light on how medieval thinkers thought they worked on the present one.</small></p>

  <p style="margin-left: 40px; line-height: 0.9"><small>The focus of this paper is Ockham’s stance on the question of divine concurrence—the question whether God is causally active in the causal happenings of the created world, and if so, what God’s causal activity amounts to and what place that leaves for created causes. As I show, Ockham, at least in this issue, is rather conservative: he agrees with the majority of medieval thinkers (including Aquinas, Giles of Rome, Duns Scotus, and others) that both God and created agents are causally active in the causal happenings of the world. Then I turn to some texts that may suggest otherwise; I argue that reading Ockham as either an occasionalist or a mere conservationist based on these texts originates from a misunderstanding of his main concern.</small></p>

<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; line-height: 0.9"><small>The present text contains a critical edition of Peter of Palude’s question of divine concurrence, found in his <i>Sentences</i> commentary, book II, d. 1, q. 4. The question concerns whether God is immediately active in every action of a creature, and if yes, how we should understand this divine concurrence. Peter, just as elsewhere in his commentary, considers at length the opinions of other thinkers and develops his own answer as a response to theirs. Although as a result of his extensive borrowing, Peter’s text might not be regarded as immensely original, it provides an interesting case study of the Dominican reaction against Durand in the early 1300’s.</small></p>

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/1_research/Toth2011aa_0.pdf">“Scientific Method in John Buridan,”</a> <i>Annual of Medieval Studies at CEU</i> 17, ed. Alice Choyke and Daniel Ziemann (Budapest: CEU Press, 2011), 23–40.
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; line-height: 0.9"><small>While some authors reproach medieval science for its over-rationality, others argue that modern science emerged precisely because of the refutation of over-empiricism that had characterized its medieval antecedent. The present paper picks out only one specific aspect of this cluster of problems, together with one specific author, that is, the meaning and role of ‘experiment’ in the treatise on vacuum in the <i>Physics</i> commentary of John Buridan. In the first section I present an overview and a possible categorization of Buridan’s experiments, which shows that these experiments were in certain respects remarkably different from those that are regarded as experiments today. In the second section I examine how these experiments relate to Buridan’s theory of science, and argue that his methodological practice is strongly dependent on his methodological theory.</small></p>

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/1_research/Toth2010a_0.pdf">“Aquinas and Buridan on the Possibility of Scientific Knowledge,”</a> In <i>Thomas Aquinas and Thomism Today</i>, ed. Bulcsú K. Hoppál (Budapest: L’Harmattan, 2010), 163–174.
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; line-height: 0.9"><small>This paper examines a specific but basic problem of Aristotelian natural philosophy, which arises if we consider the following three propositions, stated as necessary requirements towards knowledge in the proper sense (quoted now from Aristotle):
(1) The object of knowledge is of necessity and of the universal.
(2) The soul never thinks without an image.
(3) We understand something when we know its causes.
In the following, I deal only with the first two, that is, with the possible reconciliation of the empiricist and the universalistic claim. After outlining the solution of Thomas Aquinas and some criticism of it in the 14th century, I shall call attention to John Buridan, who – despite his apparent Nominalism – in certain respects, turns out to be surprisingly Thomistic.</small></p>
