I am a Lecturer in the History of Philosophy at King's College London. Before coming to the UK, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the <a href = "https://hiw.kuleuven.be/dwmc" target ="_blank"> De Wulf-Mansion Centre for Ancient, Medieval and Renaissance Philosophy</a> at KU Leuven, Belgium, working on the project "Hylomorphism Whole: 1300--1330" 
(<a href = "https://publish.obsidian.md/zvtoth" target="_blank"> see more about the project here</a>).
<br>
<br>

In the preceding years, I had been a kind of "wandering academic": after getting my PhD in 2017 from <a href = "http://www.fordham.edu" target="_blank">Fordham University</a>, I taught philosophy and mathematics at Conception Seminary College in Missouri, then moved back to the East Coast to take up a postdoc position at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, and then back to the midwest again as a Ruth Norman Halls Research Associate in philosophy at Indiana University in Bloomington, working on the Richard Rufus Project.
<br>
<br>
I grew up and spent the first quarter century of my life in Budapest, Hungary, where I attended ELTE University in philosophy and mathematics, and then got an MA in medieval studies at Central European University.
<br>
<br>
When I am not doing philosophy, I enjoy singing with the <a href="https://www.orlandochoir.org.uk" target="_blank"> Orlando Chamber Choir</a> or taking long strolls along the river.
