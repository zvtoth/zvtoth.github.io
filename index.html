I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the De Wulf-Mansion Centre for Ancient, Medieval and Renaissance Philosophy at KU Leuven, Belgium. I work on the project called "Hylomorphism Whole: 1300--1330," which, as its title suggests, aims to study medieval hylomorphism without its usual compartentalization.
In the last few years, I have been a kind of "wandering academic": after getting my PhD in 2017 from <a href = "http://www.fordham.edu" target="_blank">Fordham University</a>, I taught philosophy and mathematics at Conception Seminary College in Missouri, then moved back to the East Coast to take up a postdoc position at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, and then back to the midwest again as a Ruth Norman Halls Research Associate in philosophy at Indiana University in Bloomington, working on the Richard Rufus Project.

<br>

My main interest is later medieval philosophy, especially questions connected to metaphysics, philosophy of religion, and epistemology. I am also interested in the history of science, mainly in the connection between late medieval and early modern scientific practice and theory. My current research focuses primarily on issues connected to matter, but I also work on medieval theories of causation, and some medieval questions related to secondary causation and divine concurrence.

When I am not doing philosophy, I enjoy hiking, woodworking, and listening to and playing 14--18th-century music.
